          <p>Eli Hogan was born in Washington State, 4 days before the most important day of the year,
             and the world’s been better for it.</p>
          <p>He’s always been an old soul and it definitely felt like he had an adult’s head on him
             from a young age, especially when he was asked to stretch medals over his head.</p>

          <p>He’s always had an advanced vocabulary and understanding of humor, as well as academic topics like chemistry,
            math, geography, and Zelda Hacks.</p>
          <p>Eli’s an expert in many classes of medieval and modern weaponry.
            He’s spent hours handling blades from the broadsword to the rapier,
            as well as guns from the pistol to the rail gun. He’s fought many a valiant battle
             and always shows tremendous bravery and cunning. Of course,
              these have all been imaginary battles fought in our backyard with imaginary weapons,
               but I feel like he can probably hold his own in reality thanks to all the mental training.</p>

          <p>Eli’s always wanted to be an expert in comedy. When he was a kid he loved to read Calvin and Hobbes with me
          and ask me why it was funny with every panel. Sometimes I didn’t get it myself,
          sometimes I got annoyed and told him to try and figure it out himself,
           but then I told him enough times that eventually he was getting them all on his own
           and now he almost always gets the joke and has a knack for the popular humor trends with kids his age.
            He’s got a sharp, sarcastic but often v clever sense of humor.<p>

          <p>Eli’s incredibly loyal and will always love you for who you are.
            When he was a kid I used to do some mean things to him and I didn’t protect and love him like I should’ve.
            But he still loves me and looked up to me so much and still does now that I’ve finally got my act together
            and am trying to do better.</p>

          <p>Eli's a guy you can always count on. Even when his friends get girlfriends and start spending time with them
            instead (Talvin), or over-cuddles him on camping trips (Demetri), or goes to a different school, or has a
            very different personality/interests - as long as you're still down to be Eli's friend,
            he's always down to be yours.</p>
